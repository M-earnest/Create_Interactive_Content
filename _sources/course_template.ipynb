    "This tutorial is further paired with a template course, that you can freely [download here](https://github.com/M-earnest/course_template_diler/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). To see a rendered version of the website this template course produces follow this [link](https://m-earnest.github.io/course_template_diler/general_information/index.html). This course will in essence teach you how to adapt this template to host your own online courses. An explanation of the template can be found below.\n",
