# Course overview & procedure

Now that you've got an idea of what this website is about let's discuss how we'll hopefully get your course up and running. The following document will clarify this course's structure and general setup.

The course is divided into several modules, each covering a step in creating your course. The modules include content creation, how to structure your course "book," and how to host your course website using GitHub. You can simply start from the beginning and work your way down through all respective sections. If you're already familiar with the concepts of **GitHub** and the **Jupyter Framework**, the [Quick Set-Up](./10min.ipynb) may also be a good place to start.
The following section will illustrate the structure of the contents contained.

This tutorial is further paired with a template course that you can freely [download here](https://github.com/M-earnest/course_template_diler/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). We'll, in essence, teach you how to adapt this template to host your own online courses. An explanation of the template can be found in the respective chapter ["Course template"](https://felixkoerber.github.io/jb/course_template.html).

[Setup](./setup/setup.ipynb)

We'll need to get some software to start off with this course! 

[Introduction/Why JB-Notebooks](./intro/whyjb.ipynb)

All things gotta start somewhere, but how and why?

[Content creation](./tutorialcontent/writing.ipynb)

Here, you'll learn how to create and style content, such as the pages displayed on this website!

- [What's a Jupyter Notebook?](.tutorialcontent/writing/cells)
- [Styling: The Look and Feel](./tutorialcontent/writing/styling)
- [Embedding Media: Images, Videos and more](./tutorialcontent/writing/media)
- [Creating automatically gradable coding assignments](./tutorialcontent/writing/nbgrader)
- [Make your course interactive](https://felixkoerber.github.io/jb/tutorialcontent/writing/interactive.html)


[Structuring content](./tutorialcontent/structure)

How do we structure our course website?

[Publishing](./tutorialcontent/publishing/publishing)
- [Build and publish your course](./tutorialcontent/publishing/account)

[Troubleshooting](./tutorialcontent/troubleshooting)
Encounter any problems? Check out common sources of errors and their possible solution.

[Example Courses](./intro/demo)

[Quick Set-Up](./10min.ipynb)
If you already know some basics and want a refresher on how to quickly write, build, and host a course. 

[Ressources](./ressources/info)

Some things to help you implement a starting point for promoting a safe and productive course environment. 

- [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/questionnaires.html)
    What to look out for, what to keep in mind, and how to treat each other.
- [Code of Conduct](https://m-earnest.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2022/CoC.html)
    Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe, and inclusive learning experience.
- [Open Science](./openscience/openscience)
    Resources on how to implement open science practices in research or introduce students to the idea of open science

#### How do I get all the software, and do I have to apply for a loan to get it?

Everything we'll use is [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) or, at minimum, free of charge and publicly available. 
`*Why?*` Because teaching via [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) is just not fair and doesn't align with our values (see our open science statement). We don't want people to have to obtain licenses or be dependent on university resources or pay for software/hosting, etc., out of their own pocket. Additionally, [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) can do everything, if not more than [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) and is furthermore usually better supported, tested, and documented, creating a fantastic sense of community. 

In order to help you get all the software required for the course, a [comprehensive installation instruction](./setup/setup.ipynb) was compiled. In a step-by-step manner, it guides you through the installation process, covering several `OS`: `windows,` `MacOS,` and `Linux.` Now, the installation of the required packages probably goes beyond the scope of how most people engage with their computers daily. Therefore, errors and frustration may occur.
 **Please do not be discouraged! If any problems occur during the installation process, please feel free to contact us (or Google) and we'll get that sorted out**


#### Where is everything?

All course materials will be available on this very course website. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources). You are **free to explore, enhance, and share**. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up ideally to the end of the internet but will possibly be subject to changes and updates. If you feel the need to save this resource as it is at the moment you're reading this, you can download the complete course from our GitHub repo [here]. The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.

We will also be providing a [course template](https://github.com/M-earnest/course_template_diler) that will serve as a tool for our practical examples and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/M-earnest/course_template_diler/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). The template contains a folder structure, some example content files, a license, an open science statement, an equity, diversity, and inclusion statement, as well as a code of conduct for your course.
This template is supposed to be used as a starting point to generate your own course. Simply add your content or adapt the preexisting resources, adapt the structure to your liking, and upload the whole thing into an online GitHub repository, and your course website will be created automatically.


#### How to reach the content creators

If you have:

**Questions about course content** - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered, too, so you could use the [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) plugin, on the right-hand side of this website (overlayed over the scroll bar, you'll find buttons/functionality to annotate and highlight relevant information about this website. Feel free to use this tool to discuss, annotate, or ask questions regarding the site content there!

Otherwise, feel free to [Open an issue](https://github.com/felixkoerber/jb/issues) on the GitHub repository, and someone will try and get back to you as soon as possible or simply shoot us an e-mail!
