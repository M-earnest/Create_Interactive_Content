    "### What's a \"GitHub,\" and why should we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, GitHub is a web-based platform for storing, organizing, and managing projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content is mainly organized in repositories (or \"repos\" for short); these reports can be viewed as being equivalent to a normal directory that you have on your local machine, for, e.g., storing data and pictures.\n",
    "They may contain a variety of file types and nested directories and will be used as a place to store and organize your project files, including code, assets, and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the repository for the course template you'll be working with. Do not worry if that's still confusing to you; learning how to work with Github is best done using a \"learning-by-doing\" approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/felixkoerber/jb/blob/main/static/template.png?raw=true\" alt=\"png depicting the file structure of the course template repository\" class=\"bg-primary\" width=\"500px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Version control and collaborative work\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure we've all lost important documents, codes, or progress while working in academia. If you've been doing programming work, you might also have encountered that fixing a bug may lead to other substantial bugs down the line. \n",
    "So people generally tend to come up with their own solution for \"project management,\" e.g., by maintaining multiple files, e.g., project_working_copy_1.txt, project_notes.txt,  project_final_draft_3 or at times by making a mess of our documents by storing cut or to be implemented content in its own sub-section at the end of project_draft_4.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Github alleviates that problem by making use of \"Git,\" a distributed version control system, which logs each time a change is made to a file. Via the commit system, we can not only maintain different versions of the same file on, e.g., your local system and the connected public repository, but also revert changes that had negative consequences or recover information lost on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git further makes it easy to work with multiple users on the same project, as each user can maintain their local versions and submit their changes to the public directory, which can then be reviewed by the team on quality and compatibility and subsequently be incorporated into the online project.\n",

    "\n",
    "[**Forking**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks): Creating a copy of someones repository, that you want to work with. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. For example, you will create an online copy of another repository under your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Cloning**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-remote): Meaning to create a local copy of an online repository (called \"remote\"s on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Branching**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches): Meaning to create a copy of a project either online or locally, so that you have an isolated copy where you can work without affecting other branches in a repository. Each repository has one default branch, usually called the \"main\" branch, and can have multiple other branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Committing**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-commit): A commit is a \"snapshot\" of your repository at one specific point in time. If you change a repository, you will have to follow up with \"committing\" the changes to save file changes to your Git repository. This does not mean that your changes will be lost if you, e.g., shut down your system; it just means that the version between a file on your system and the logged version in the GitHub repository does not match.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pulling**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-pull): Means simply to update you local repository with the corresponidng online (remote) repository. For, if you or someone else made changes to the online version of a repository, you pull or \"download\" these changes to your local files this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pushing**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/problems/git-push-to-remote-branch): Git push is used to upload a local repository’s content to a remote repository. Meaning that you send your locally committed changes to your online repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Clone the repository**: To start working with your repository, you will need to \"clone\" it to your local computer. This will create a copy of the repository on your computer that you can work with. To clone a repository, click on the \"Clone or download\" button and copy the URL. \n",

    "**3. Make changes**: Now that you have a local copy of the repository, you can change the code. Simply open the files in your editor and make the changes you want, or create new files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Commit changes**: When you're done making changes, you'll need to \"commit\" them to the repository. Committing a change records it in the repository's history and makes it part of the codebase. \n",
