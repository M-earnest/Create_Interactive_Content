    "In Jupyter Books, there few different ways to include images. Here we will highlight the way that is most optimal for hosting the Book with our provided gh-actions script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way is to add the images to your projects in the static folder of your project. Once you push/ upload the project to your GitHub you essentially are hosting the images through their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add images in your Jupyter Book, use the following line of Markdown in a markdown cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "`![alternative_imagetext](https://YOURGITHUBNAME.github.io/PROJECTNAME/_static/FILENAME.png)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Resulting, for example, in:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alternative_imagetext](https://felixkoerber.github.io/jb/_static/logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are able to use essentially any imagelink, you can add images that are hosted through other websites, too!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want more control about the size, orientation and more, you will have to rely on HTML tags. E.g. the following line of code will present the same image as above only downscaled to a width of 200 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`<img src=\"https://felixkoerber.github.io/jb/_static/logo.png\" alt=\"logo\" class=\"bg-primary mb-1\" width=\"200px\">\n",

    "\n",
    "`src=\"(https://YOURGITHUBNAME.github.io/PROJECTNAME/_static/FILENAME.png\"` is an attribute that specifies the URL or path to the image file you want to display. In this case, it points to an image file on GitHub with a specific URL that you will need to replace with your own GitHub account name, project name, and file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "`alt=\"alternative_imagetext\"` is an attribute that provides alternative text for the image. This text is used by screen readers for visually impaired users, and it is also displayed when the image cannot be loaded for some reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "`class=\"bg-primary mb-1\"` is an attribute that defines the CSS class or classes to apply to the image. In this case, the class bg-primary sets the background color of the image to a primary color, and mb-1 adds a margin-bottom of 1 unit to the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "`width=\"200px\"` is an attribute that sets the width of the image to 200 pixels. This can be adjusted to suit your needs.\n",
